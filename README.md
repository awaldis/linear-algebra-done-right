# "Linear Algebra Done Right" in Lean

The repo contains selected proofs, rendered in the Lean Proof Assistant language, from Sheldon Axler's "Linear Algebra Done Right" (https://linear.axler.net/).

These proofs are optimized for understandability by a human reader and therefore refrain from using certain Lean tactics that could make them shorter.
